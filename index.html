			<p>
			In the current climate, immigrants in Blaine County, Idaho are increasingly vulnerable and isolated, avoiding medical treatment, emergency services, 
			and court or police protection for fear that they or their family members will be deported. The Safe Communities Act restores confidence 
			in local public institutions by allowing our police and court officials to focus on public safety instead of getting tangled up in immigration 
			enforcement.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>1. Ensures police and court officials do not inquire about immigration status unless required by law. </strong><br>
			<ul>
			<li>
				The Blaine County Sheriff's office has immediate coordination and cooperation with ICE when a person does not have a Social Security number, 					honestly admits they are not a U.S. citizen, or gives false information about their true identity. 
				<a href="https://www.mtexpress.com/news/blaine_county/sheriff-s-office-shares-data-on-arrests-and-training/article_a7f3a8be-e1a7-11ea-ab74-67bc9a0073e2.html">Source</a>   <br>
				Ensuring police and court officials do not inquire about immigration status unless required by law is especially important to immigrant survivors 				of domestic violence and those who assist them, including medical providers, who seek assurance that the abuse can safely be reported to the 					police.
			</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>2. Protects basic rights, just like a “Miranda” warning.</strong><br>
			<ul>
			<li>
			Before ICE questions someone in local custody, police would need to obtain their consent on a 
			form that explains their right to decline an interview or have their own attorney present, just like a 
			“Miranda” warning in a criminal context. Otherwise, people often unwittingly jeopardize their immigration 
			cases and their ability to keep their families together.
			</li>
			</ul>	
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>3. Creates standards for law enforcement and court officials to notify ICE only when a person is released after serving a sentence, not before.				</strong> <br>
			<ul>
			<li>
			Current practice undermines our court system by encouraging ICE to take custody of people before they have 
			their day in court, denying justice to victims and defendants alike. This provision does not restrict 
			other types of law enforcement communications with ICE.
			</li>
			</ul>	
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<strong>4. Ends 287(g) agreements.</strong> <br>
			<ul>
			<li>
				Prevents contracts with ICE that allow state or local law enforcement to act as federal immigration agents, at state expense. 
			Because county sheriffs often serve as temporary jailors for small police departments, these contracts damage the relationship 
			between immigrant communities and the police they rely on for protection.
			</li>
			</ul>			
			</p>
		
			<p>
			<strong>5. Requires law enforcement training on this guidance.</strong> <br>
			<ul>
			<li>
				Ensures that law enforcement agencies incorporate this guidance into their training programs and permits the filing of a 
			complaint about alleged violations with the relevant agencies or with the Attorney General’s civil rights division, which will 
			annually summarize any complaints received.
			</li>
			</ul>
