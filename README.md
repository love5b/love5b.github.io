## Thanksgiving Prayer and Meditation


Let us all take a moment to arrive fully in this space. Gently close your eyes if you feel comfortable, or let your gaze soften. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow any tension to leave your body. Feel the warmth of this room, the connection of the people gathered, and the energy we share.

In this moment, we honor the journey of the food before us. We give gratitude for the earth, the sun, and the rain that nurtured the seeds and brought forth life. To the hands of the farmers and workers who planted, tended, and harvested these gifts, we send our thanks. May their labor be met with appreciation and abundance in their lives.

To the cooks who infused these ingredients with care, creativity, and love, we are grateful. To Cecilee and her family, who opened their home and their hearts to bring us together in this space, thank you for your generosity and warmth.

Let us also recognize the energy within ourselves and one another—the effort, thoughtfulness, and intention it took to come together today. May this food nourish not just our bodies but our spirits, and may it remind us of the sustaining power of community, love, and shared purpose.

As we sit together, let us remember those who are not at this table—whether by distance, loss, or circumstance. May they feel the light and love of connection wherever they are. And may this gathering inspire us to carry forward kindness, patience, and gratitude in the days ahead.

Take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, imagine sending warmth and appreciation into the room, into the meal, and into each heart here.

With gratitude for the journey, the labor, the love, and the spirit of togetherness, let us eat, enjoy, and celebrate.

Amen.
